<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project  :rocket:

The system features a main screen (Landing) that contains:

- A navigation sidebar

## Roadmap 	:world_map:

### Week 01

This week's assigment consisted of creating a screenflow in Figma using the UI kit provided by Radium Rocket. We had to design the landing page, the admin page, the super admin page, and a page for their partners.

### Week 02

The task for week 02 was to create an HTML document that has the same content as the landing page from the screenflow in the first week, and save the progress in a public Github repository.

This HTML code represents a webpage that promotes a gym called MegaRocket SA. The page starts with a header that includes the gym's title and logo. Then, there's a navigation bar that includes links to the home page, registration, login, and a contact section.

Most of the content is in the main section, where the gym's philosophy and equipment are described. Information about the personalized services offered is also provided, and users are invited to join the gym's community.

The page also has a "About Us" section where the gym's roots and history are presented. Finally, there's a "Contact" section that includes a form where visitors can send their questions or comments to the gym's team.

### Week 03

This week, we had to use CSS to make the HTML from week 2 look as close as possible to the design created in Figma in week 1. The HTML code imports two CSS files, "reset.css" and "style.css," to apply styles to the page. The "reset.css" file resets the default styles of HTML elements, and the "style.css" file contains custom styles for the page's components.

### Week 04

This week we created the landing page for the Mega Rocket website, but this time we used the flexbox property to make the page responsive using the "mobile first" philosophy. We also created the mobile version (maximum 600px), iPad version (maximum 1020px), and desktop version (1020px and beyond).
This week, we also set up GitHub Pages to create a live repository. Through the following link, you can access my repository to see the updated index for this week: https://katairala.github.io/BaSP-M2023/week-04/.

### Week 05

The objective of this week was to understand the syntax of JavaScript in order to solve problems and acquire the ability to propose a valid solution for a particular problem. For this purpose, a series of exercises were provided to us, which we had to solve and save in the Github repository. We learned the uses of loops, arrays, functions, variables, and operations. Through the following link, you can see the index where the exercises are saved in the console. https://katairala.github.io/BaSP-M2023/week-05/.

### Week 06

For this week, we created the login and sign up page with HTML and CSS, connected it to the landing page, and used JavaScript to create different events when filling out the forms.
With a blur event, an error message is displayed if the field does not meet the validations, and with a focus event, the error message disappears. In addition, when the submit button is pressed, different alerts appear, one for an error in case the validations are not met, and one confirming the entered data if they were valid.

### Week 07

On this week's assigment we had to extend the forms from week 06 so that when the confirmation buttons are pressed, the data loaded in them is sent to a web server through an HTTP request from JavaScript. In each form, we made an HTTP request using the Fetch method of JavaScript, sending all the data loaded in the form. If the response is successful, a confirmation alert is displayed and the data is loaded into the browser's LocalStorage. If it is not successful, an error alert is displayed.
