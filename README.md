# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Week 01
In week 1, we designed the website for MEGA ROCKET SA, a system to manage and organize the gym's schedule grid, employee schedules, activities, and memberships with its members. We used the Figma platform for this.

## Week 02
This week, we used Git, GitHub, and HTML to create the landing page for the website.
